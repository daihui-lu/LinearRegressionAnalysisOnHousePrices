# Linear Regression Analysis on House Prices
In this project, we will use statistical methods to predict the house prices in Ames, Iowa. The
Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. The goal of this study is to build a regression model to predict the house price using the multiple features from the house price data.

This report is organized as follows: 
- In Section 2, we will describe the data set and do some exploratory data analysis; 
- In Section 3, we will build a linear regression model and conduct model selection with forward selection method; 
- In Section 4, we will add interaction terms to the linear model and conduct model selection with forward selection method; 
- In Section 5, we will do some diagnositic tests and influence analysis; 
- Finally, in Section 6, we will summarize this results.
